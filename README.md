## Project Info

### Project Overview

The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form:

> “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

Users are able to:

- answer questions
- see which questions they haven’t answered
- see how other people have voted
- post questions, and
- see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

### Why this project?

- To solidify my understanding of React and Redux while giving me a chance to express my creativity.
- To practice improving the predictability of my application’s state
- To establish strict rules for getting, listening, and updating the store
- To identify what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside of React components.

### App Architecture

For this application, most of the application’s state is managed by Redux.
Application’s code is structured and organized in a logical way, and components are modular and reusable.

## About Me

I am passionate about helping businesses and individuals create more value with the web, as well as helping fellow students learn software development.

I recently spoke at a student conference organized by Microsoft Student Partners in South Africa. Currently, I am a Student Ambassador at FlutterWave as well as enrolled in the Udacity React Nanodegree course to update my front-end knowledge and skill

In the future, I hope to update my back-end skills, learn mobile and cloud-native development, as well as AI/Machine Learning. These, combined with my passion for learning and teaching together with my front-end skills will allow me to create more value for more businesses and individuals, as well as encourage the early adoption of software development skills.
